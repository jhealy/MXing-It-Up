# MXing-It-Up

St Pete .NET - MX-ing it up Holiday Social

St Pete .NET has a buch of Arduino based MX Chip IoT DevKits.  So why not some fun labs!  Directional finding using the magnometer, pulling gifs with Azure IoT hub, and some optional exercises if you work ahead.  Loaner boards will be available for the day, but if a large number of people show up you may have to share.  If you wish to procure your own you can purchase the Azure IoT DevKit with the MX chip from the Amazon link below.   Expect lectures on various topics and a good bit of time to experiment on your own.  Wrap the day with a Saturday social in St Pete!

## MX CHIP DIRECTION HANDS ON LAB

Configure your MX chip and push code to it showing the current orientation of the device.  Art Garcia has promised some really cool descriptions of this session here.  He has to buy beer if he lets us down.

## MX CHIP AZURE IOT GIF LAB

Configure your MX Chip enabled Arduino to pull gifs down from Azure IoT hub.  During this lab you will create an IoT Hub, configure your MX Arduino, push code to the arduino, connect it to the Azure IoT Hub, and pull down some gifs to the OLED screen on the Arduino.
